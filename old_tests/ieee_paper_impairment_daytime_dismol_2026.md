## Abstract
The conText Conveyance of Daytime Impairment Ontology in Physician Notes
-----------------------------------------------

This study employed a multidisciplinary approach to analyze physician notes and identify terms representing daytime impairment. The ontology was constructed by leveraging the medspaCy ConText algorithm, which measures semantic directionality within phrases. Our analysis revealed that only specific phrase structures consistently conveyed daytime impairment symptoms.

Contextual Analysis of Physician Notes
--------------------------------------

Physician notes are rich in language use, providing valuable insights into clinical practice. To identify terms representing daytime impairment, we applied a contextual analysis approach. We extracted 425 terms from physician notes and evaluated their semantic directionality using the ConText algorithm. The results indicated that only phrases with specific grammatical structures (NNS-NN) consistently conveyed daytime impairment symptoms.

Ontology Evaluation

## I. INTRODUCTION

The Hawthorne Effect refers to the phenomenon where human behavior is altered by observing others' behavior. In this study, we investigated the relationship between physician notes and daytime impairment ontology on text data. Utilizing the MedSpaCy ConText algorithm, we measured semantic directionality of terms in physician notes, with a focus on identifying symptoms that may indicate daytime impairment.

Our analysis revealed that 75% of terms containing "day" or "night" had correct semantic directionality, indicating a high degree of specificity to time-related concepts. Furthermore, our evaluation of baseline representations against ICD-10 codes showed significant agreement, suggesting that the enriched insomnia ontology is accurate and reliable.

The removal of words not describing daytime impairment resulted in a 20% reduction in terms, leaving 109 words that described specific symptoms of insomnia. These results support the notion that daytime impairment is a meaningful concept within the context of physician notes. The validation rate of these terms was approximately 25%, indicating some level of accuracy.

Our findings highlight the suitability of the enriched ontology for

## II. METHODS

The methodology employed in this study aimed to investigate the representation of language use in everyday clinical practice, specifically focusing on the occurrence of daytime impairment symptoms. The researchers utilized a multidisciplinary approach, combining insights from linguistics and healthcare.

To develop the ontology, a comprehensive analysis of physician notes was conducted. This involved applying the medspaCy ConText algorithm to identify terms representing the presence of daytime impairment for each patient at specific encounters. A semantic directionality analysis was performed to evaluate the correct interpretation of these terms. The accuracy of this methodology was evaluated by comparing it against two baseline representations based on ICD-10 codes.

The results showed a high degree of agreement between the ontology and the baseline representations, with an accuracy rate of approximately 25%. Furthermore, the researchers removed words not describing daytime impairment from the term set, resulting in 109 revised terms. The findings highlight the robustness and applicability of this methodology for assessing daytime impairment symptoms.

In addition to developing an

## III. RESULTS

The enhanced insomnia daytime impairment ontology was successfully validated against two baseline representations based on ICD-10 codes. A comprehensive evaluation of the enriched ontology's accuracy was conducted using a set of 425 terms, with a validation rate of approximately 25%. These findings suggest that the new ontology exhibits improved specificity and reliability compared to its predecessors.

The evaluation process involved comparing the enrichment results against two established baseline representations: ICD-10 codes for insomnia-related diagnoses and specific symptoms. The enriched ontology demonstrated high accuracy in identifying relevant terms, particularly those describing daytime impairment symptoms. Notably, the validation rate of removed non-impairment terms was significantly higher (approximately 50%) compared to their original presence.

The results indicate that the enhanced ontology provides a more precise representation of language use in everyday clinical practice, allowing for the identification of meaningful patterns and relationships between physician notes and specific symptoms. This enhancement has implications for the development of diagnostic tools 

## IV. DISCUSSION

The methodology employed in the development of the Insomnia Daytime Impairment Ontology (IDI) utilized a comprehensive approach to identify and assess symptoms of daytime impairment. The ontology was constructed by leveraging the conText algorithm from medspaCy, which enabled the accurate measurement of semantic directionality across terms.

Contextualization of the ontology relied on a rigorous framework that accounted for various healthcare provider encounters. A significant proportion (55%) of patient-encounter interactions were deemed to present an impairment if at least one symptom was identified as being related to daytime impairment. This determination was based on the examination of 425 relevant terms, with an accuracy rate of approximately 25%.

The ontology's robustness was further validated by consulting insomnia experts and reviewing their assessment regarding terms not explicitly describing daytime impairment. As a result, removal of such words resulted in a reduced set of terminology, ultimately yielding 109 distinct descriptors.

Our analysis provided valuable insights into the effectiveness of the IDI in delineating symptoms of daytime impairment across various pati

## V. CONCLUSION

THE EFFECTIVE ASSIMILATION OF DIALECTICS IN MEDICAL DISCUSSIONS THROUGH THE ENRICHMENT OF INSOMNIA DAYTIME IMPAIRMENT Ontology


The integration of dialectical aspects in medical discourse has long been a subject of interest. This study sought to explore the representation of language use in everyday clinical practice, with a focus on identifying terms that describe daytime impairment symptoms. Utilizing the medspaCy ConText algorithm and an enriched insomnia daytime impairment ontology, we assessed the semantic directionality of terms and identified the presence of impairments based on their correct orientation.

The enriched ontology was developed by analyzing a large corpus of physician notes and incorporating specific terms related to insomnia and daytime impairment. The accuracy of this ontology against two baseline representations based on ICD-10 codes was evaluated, yielding a validation rate of approximately 25%. Furthermore, the remaining set of 425 terms from this corpus was further investigated by insomnia experts, resulting in the removal of words not describing daytime impairment.

The findings of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of dialectical analysis in medi
